  This paper introduces the automation measurement software
  FlexSensor for capturing resonant spectra, an innovative
  and extensible software program developed explicitly for
  measuring and evaluating wafer-level Silicon Photonic
  (SiPh) circuits. Wafer-level Silicon Photonics allows the
  integration of numerous optical components and structures
  on a single wafer. However, researchers and engineers need
  precise and repeatable measurements to characterize them
  and face significant challenges when dealing with large
  numbers of complex systems on a single wafer. A toolchain
  gap hampers the measuring of such highly integrated
  photonic structures: While the setup necessitates the
  integration of an optimized hardware and software
  toolchain, there is neither software nor a standardized
  way to implement a reproducible measurement routine for a
  massive set of measurements.


  FlexSensor allows integration and control of external
  hardware (tunable lasers, analogâ€“digital converters) and
  supports measurement data storage and evaluation. The
  software enables researchers and engineers to efficiently
  analyze the spectral response of photonic structures and
  facilitate rapid measuring.
